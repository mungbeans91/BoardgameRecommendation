# BoardgameRecommendation
Build a boardgame recommendation website using data from boardgamegeek.com. Type in one or more boardgames that you like and the system will give recommendations based on your preferences. You can also filter the recommended boardgames based on different parameters such as playing time, number of players, game type, and mechanisms, etc. This project used techniques such as web scraping, API scraping, NLP, recommender system, and website deployment.
